# Breast Cancer 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Early diagnosis of breast tumors as non-cancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant) is very important for good outcomes. However, diagnosis by doctors can be subjective and inconsistent.

Machine learning models can be trained to predict if breast tumors are cancerous based on tumor cell features. This analysis aims to apply machine learning to diagnose breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. This data has cell measurements that classify tumors. We test 4 common machine learning models - KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The model with the best accuracy can correctly diagnose cancer and provide rationale for using machine learning for breast cancer screening. Accurate prediction can assist doctors and detect cancer earlier to save lives.
